# X Country

Want to know where a post on X/Twitter is coming from? This little helper drops a ❓ next to every username. Hover it, and you’ll see the country the account says it’s based in. That’s the whole story.

## Install in under a minute

1. Download or clone this folder anywhere on your computer.
2. Open Chrome and visit `chrome://extensions`.
3. Toggle **Developer mode** in the top-right corner.
4. Hit **Load unpacked** and pick the `xcountry` folder (look for `manifest.json` inside).
5. Optional but nice: pin the extension so you can switch it on or off quickly.

No builds, no packaging, no store listing.

## Use it

1. Scroll through X/Twitter like you normally do.
2. A ❓ sits right after each display name.
3. Hover it:
   - ⏳ means “hold on, checking…”
   - A country flag or name pops in once found.
   - ❌ means the site wouldn’t tell us—just hover again later.
4. Once you’ve seen a country for a user, it sticks. The icon jumps straight to the answer next time.

## Need a break?

Head back to `chrome://extensions` and flip the switch off, or remove it entirely. No other setup to undo.
